** Things to do
*** DONE check and label the units as base units
CLOSED: [2023-08-21 Mon 23:51]
universally output =DimensionedValue= in base units in the trait implementations
*** DONE convert single numbers into base units..
CLOSED: [2023-08-21 Mon 23:52]
currently single number expressions are stored without converting to base units
=c = 1[km];= produces as output:
#+begin_example
Calculating Variable {
    name: Name(
        "c",
    ),
    expr: Double {
        value: 1.0,
        dimension: Length {
            unit: Kilometer,
        },
    },
}

Storing result DimensionedValue {
    value: 1.0,
    dimension: Length {
        unit: Kilometer,
    },
}

// it should be
Storing result DimensionedValue {
    value: 1000.0,
    dimension: Length {
        unit: Meter,
    },
}

#+end_example
its stored in km
*** DONE Get names in
CLOSED: [2023-08-22 Tue 00:13]
#+begin_src
a = 1[km];
b = (2[m] * 2[km]);
c = (a + b);
#+end_src
*** DONE Vectorise calculations
CLOSED: [2023-08-23 Wed 09:49]
#+begin_src
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5][km];
b = ([4, 6, 32, 7, 9][m] * [25, 2, 2, 1, 5][km]);
c = (a + b);
#+end_src
- [X] vector support
- [X] parse and support scalars & vectors together
  - [X] parse scalars as single element lists
  - [X] extend single element lists to length of other list

#+begin_quote
Generic =DimensionedValue= with different =Mul + Add + ..= implementations
takes =f64=, =Vec<f64>=
#+end_quote
Turned out to be: generic types (=struct<T>=) with type specific behaviour in traits.
*** TODO Add dimensionless values
  - [ ] parse dimensionless values without units (scalars/scalar vecs without units) as values with power 0 and units None
*** TODO Add multiplication across unit families
unit families?
eg currency / time.. it remains unresolved in the equation, we need to represent these
or are these just dimensions?
when the unit family is different + and - make no sense but * and / do, you get currency / time for example
*** TODO Parse csvs with declared var names as column headings
#+begin_src
a = csv{height_of_side[km]};
b = csv{width_of_base[m]};
c = (a * b);
#+end_src
*** TODO =impl Fmt for MyTypes=
so that we can print out vector and non vector calculations
*** TODO Add a cli
